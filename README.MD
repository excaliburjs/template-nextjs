# Excalibur Next.js (TypeScript) Starter

This is a barebones [Excalibur](https://excaliburjs.com) game engine starter built using Next.js (v15) and React (v19). It's a great starting place to jumpstart building your game! This repo is a template and can be used to [create your own repository](https://github.com/excaliburjs/template-nextjs/generate) in GitHub.

Check out our [other samples](https://excaliburjs.com/samples) while you build your game or [ask us questions](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/discussions).

## Get Started

* Using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (18 LTS - minimum) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* Run the `npm install` to install dependencies
* Run the `npm run dev` to run the development server to test out changes
   * [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) will automatically handle turning the [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) into Javascript and hosting the dev server.

## Publishing

* Run `npm run build` to produce production bundles. Note Next.js has a variety of [options/settings](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) to familiarize yourself with, from server side rendering to static bundles.

### Notes

When deploying an Excalibur app in a Next.js context, given the Next.js API and strong support for [React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components), one should ensure a good familiarity with the basics of the Next.js [docs](https://nextjs.org/learn) if straying too far from this template. Remember, this a barebones example, and Excalibur depends on client side APIs to run correctly.

Happy coding!
